						  Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growth that can cause certain symptoms and hamper daily activities 
						  if they are large in size, many in number of deeply entrenched in the uterus.
						  Through myomectomy, only the fibroids are removed from the uterus and not the entire uterus as
						  in the case of hysterectomy.The types of Myomectomy procedures are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Laparoscopic Myomectomy</li>
							<li>Hysteroscopic Myomectomy</li>
							<li>Laparotomy or Abdominal Myomectomy</li>
						</ul>

						<div className="section-heading">Indication</div>
						<p>Myomectomy is a procedure recommended to women suffering from the symptoms of uterine fibroids such as ureteral obstruction and acute anemia. When fibroids start affecting a womanâ€™s lifestyle due to heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure and urinary frequency, then surgery becomes essential to remove the fibroids from the uterus. </p>
						<div className="section-heading">Pre-Procedure </div>
						<p>If a patient is soon going to undergo a myomectomy, she must adhere to the following instructions, which a doctor may recommend to minimize risk during surgery:</p>
						<p>Iron supplements and vitamins: Women suffering from iron deficiency due to heavy menstrual bleeding can take vitamins and iron supplements to increase the blood count before the surgery. </p>
						<p>Therapy to reduce the size of fibroids: There are certain hormonal therapies that help reduce the size of uterus and fibroid to facilitate easy removal of fibroids using minimal invasive approach. GnRH agonist therapy is recommended to shrink the fibroid size and in most cases, this therapy may cause symptoms of menopause such as dryness of vagina, hot flashes and night sweats. The treatment for this therapy continues for a couple of months before surgery and usually the discomfort ends after the medication has been stopped. </p>
						<p>Hormonal Treatment: Birth control pills, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or even other hormonal medication are prescribed months before the surgery to put a stop to the production of progesterone and estrogen. Although, this stops menstruation, it enables the increase of iron and hemoglobin. </p>
						<div className="section-heading">During Procedure </div>
						<p>Myomectomy as a surgical procedure can be carried out in three different ways depending on the size and the number of fibroids. It generally takes an hour or two for the completion of the operation. </p>
