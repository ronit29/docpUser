Long hours spent at the office meeting deadlines, interpersonal conflicts, and keeping up with regularly changing technology is becoming too much to bear. No wonder, health problems are ubiquitous. While development in medical science allows professionals to combat various ailments, awareness among common people is crucial.</p>
                                                        <p>Preventive health care checkup means identification and minimization of disease risk factors, existing disease course improvement, and early disease detection through screening. This has become crucial since it allows people to know about their health issues well within time. You may be sitting on a health landmine and have no inkling of it. Diagnosis of cancer in later stages is completely ineffectual and heart disease may translate into instant death. These are silent killers and the only way to deal with them is to remain aware of the issues through regular checkups and taking preventive care.</p>
